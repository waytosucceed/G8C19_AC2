    <p style="text-align: left;">The new ideas that we learnt from the reading and discussion of ‘The Cop and the
      Anthem” are as follows:
      <br><br>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
      <li><b><u>Irony</u> : </b>Irony typically refers to a discrepancy between appearance and reality. Irony in literature
        is the purposeful disconnect between the subject matter and the language employed. When a
        character's point of view diverges from the narrator's or reader's, irony ensues.<br> <i>‘Soapy’s spirit was
          proud’</i> The given sentence is ironic.<br> Soapy was living on the streets, but he felt that living as a
        vagrant
        would damage his pride, so he decided to stay in the prison reserved for criminals.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b><u>Deus ex machina</u> : </b>The anthem acts as deus ex machina which induced the epiphany in Soapy and
        caused his self-introspection. <i>‘deus ex machina’</i> is a latin phrase which refers to ‘godly machinery’ or
        ‘godly intervention’ that helps to resolve a problem or entangle a plot. The anthem is associated with
        the church which means it is associated with God. If the sweet music of the familiar anthem had not
        reached Soapy’s ears and reminded him of the days when he knew the anthem so well, Soapy would not
        have been moved by it to an extent such that he experienced a change in him. As a result he intricately
        and deeply introspects himself.</li>
        <br>

      <li><b><u>Situational Irony</u> : </b>Situational irony is when the outcome is the opposite or completely different from
        what was expected.Situational irony contradicts reasonable expectations and logical cause-and-effect
        linkages. A situation like this appears "unfair".<br> Situational irony is characterised by this feeling of
        being
        "unfair" or "unfortunate." People start to wonder if the universe makes sense because they are unable to
        explain the unfairness.The ending of the story is indeed ironic for Soapy as well as the readers. Soapy
        had been dreaming of prison life for the winter and the entire day he was literally imposing himself on
        cops to get arrested. <br>However, when he was returning to Madison square with a frustrated mind, the
        anthem which is a godly intervention induces him to change himself completely to an extent that he
        was now at peace with himself with a rewired mind and better hopes for the future. Blackwell’s Island
        is no more his dream now. It is O. Henry’s adept use of situational irony that fulfilled Soapy’s dream of
        his immediate past right in front of the church.</li>
